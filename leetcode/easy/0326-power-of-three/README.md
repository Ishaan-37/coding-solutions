![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer `n`, return  *`true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`*.

An integer `n` is a power of three, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3x`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 27
Output: true
Explanation: 27 = 33

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3x = 0.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: n = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3x = (-1).

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- -231 <= n <= 231 - 1

 

 **Follow up:**  Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

            n //= 3
        return n == 1
```
