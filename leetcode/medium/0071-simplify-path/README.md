# Simplify Path

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an  *absolute*  path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash `'/'`. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its  **simplified canonical path**.

The  *rules*  of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

- A single period '.' represents the current directory.
- A double period '..' represents the previous/parent directory.
- Multiple consecutive slashes such as '//' and '///' are treated as a single slash '/'.
- Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name. For example, '...' and '....' are valid directory or file names.

The simplified canonical path should follow these  *rules* :

- The path must start with a single slash '/'.
- Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash '/'.
- The path must not end with a slash '/', unless it is the root directory.
- The path must not have any single or double periods ('.' and '..') used to denote current or parent directories.

Return the  **simplified canonical path**.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  path = "/home/"

 **Output:**  "/home"

 **Explanation:** 

The trailing slash should be removed.

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  path = "/home//foo/"

 **Output:**  "/home/foo"

 **Explanation:** 

Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

 **Example 3:** 

 **Input:**  path = "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures"

 **Output:**  "/home/user/Pictures"

 **Explanation:** 

A double period `".."` refers to the directory up a level (the parent directory).

 **Example 4:** 

 **Input:**  path = "/../"

 **Output:**  "/"

 **Explanation:** 

Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.

 **Example 5:** 

 **Input:**  path = "/.../a/../b/c/../d/./"

 **Output:**  "/.../b/d"

 **Explanation:** 

`"..."` is a valid name for a directory in this problem.

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= path.length <= 3000
- path consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.
- path is a valid absolute Unix path.

        return '/' + '/'.join(stack)
```
