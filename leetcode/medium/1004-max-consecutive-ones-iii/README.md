# Max Consecutive Ones III

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return  *the maximum number of consecutive* `1` *'s in the array if you can flip at most*  `k` `0`'s.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
- 0 <= k <= nums.length

```py
class Solution(object):
    def longestOnes(self, nums, k):
        left = 0
        zeros = 0
        ans = 0
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] == 0:
                zeros += 1
            while zeros > k:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    zeros -= 1
                left += 1
            ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
        return ans
```
